======================================================================

When you start to build the cfd calculation for your project you have to perform following steps. 
I recommend to start with a new empty case, to be aware of all your changes. 

* [prep/geometry](geometry.md)  
* [prep/mesh](mesh.md)
* [prep/physics](physics.md)
