Step 1: creating/modifying a geometry
------------------------------------------------------------

Normally you start with an empty file or get some basic CAD files from your construction departement. 
Keep in mind: You do not model the pipe, **you model the volume inside the pipe**. 

This [FreeCAD-Tutorial] is a good start to get used to FreeCAD for creating 3D Models.  


Now open FreeCAD. 
At Windows use your "Windows Search"
At a native Linux you can open FreeCAD with `freecad freecad-cfd.FCStd` or `make freecad-open` and loading directly the already prepared data in the linked freecad-file. 

    freecad freecad-cfd.FCStd


On the left side in the model tree all content in this file is listed.  
![](../../resources/freecad-combo-view.png)  
To toggle the visibility of specific entries you can mark some and hit the space bar. 
To getting to know each entry make all entries invisible (greyed out) and test what is appearing when you switch it to visible again.
