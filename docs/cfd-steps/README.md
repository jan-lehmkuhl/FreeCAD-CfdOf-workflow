Executing the CFD-Process
======================================================================

The CFD-process has following steps:  

* [Preprocessing](preprocessing/README.md)
    * the geometry
    * the mesh
    * the physics
* [Calculating the Mesh](calculate-mesh.md)  
* [Solving the CFD Case](solve-cfd-case.md)  
* Postprocessing
    * Review residuals 
    * Review monitor points
    * Review the 3D data with [Paraview](postprocessing-with-paraview.md)  
    * [Export pictures as png](../installation/paraview.python.md)
