Paraview Python for Command Line Interface
======================================================================

To run [Paraview Picture Export](../../scripts/paraview-export-all.py) under Linux you need Paraview Python capabilities with `pvbatch` and `pvpython`. 

    pvbatch --version
    pvpython --version


In Ubuntu 24.06 these tools are bundled already with the [OpenFOAM](openfoam.md) installation. 
When these commands cannot be executed in the terminal, an [additional paraview](paraview.linux.manual.md) must be installed for Linux or WSL.
