Management-Summary
===============================================================================

Background
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<!-- 
* which information is needed to understand the project goals
* this should be understand by every friend or manager
 -->


Goals
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<!-- 
* which goal should be reached within this project
  * maximum 400 characters
  * bulletpoints with max 10 words
  * more explanations belong to the background
* more than one goal should be avoided
  * multiple goals are complex to reach 
* goals are about knowledge to achieve
  * e.g. optimize the flow in something, understand the physics from something
  * this is not about simulations
    * simulations are the howto-tools to reach your goals and 
    * simulations are explained later in the report
 -->


Major Work Packages
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<!-- 
* maximum 700 characters
    * detailed explanations later
* which simulations are/will be used to achieve your goals
* which special information should each study (group of similar simulations) deliver to reach the project goals
* which numbers are calculated in the postprocessing
 -->


Issues which jeopardize the project 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<!-- 
* where are not yet solved issues or problems which can threaten the project outcome
* e.g. numerics in study 1 are bad, you don't know yet to apply special model features, ...
 -->


Results
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<!-- 
* which goals or partial goals are reached at this moment
* can be devided in parts for every study
 -->


Project-Forecast
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<!-- 
* next steps and timeframe
* whats your plan for the next week
 -->



Available Resources
===============================================================================

Timeframe
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<!--

Calculation Enviroment
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<!--

Simulation Study 1
===============================================================================
<!-- 
* collection of simulations which share similar geometry and settings
* together these simulation study leads to specific conclusions
* e.g. test of geometry changes
* a second study might be a simulation to determine specific boundary conditions for a first study
* describe which conclusions will be desirable from each study
 -->


Reality Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Geometry
<!-- 
* description of the geometry features and their size
* use real world pictures not simplified CAD data
 -->


### Physics
<!-- 
* which physical effects occur
* make sketches to describe special effects (you need less words)

 -->

#### Global Residuals 

#### Imbalances

#### Yplus
<!-- only on relevant faces -->

#### Monitor Point Stability


### Analysis Type
<!-- 
* is this a transient simulation or indicate the residuals and monitor points a transient behaviour
 -->


### Numerical Confidence
<!-- 
* how exact, do you think, are the calculation results
* how big are the changes in the result, when you change the setup
 -->



Flow Analysis 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<!-- 
* show expected behaviour to increase the confidence in the simulation
* show special and interesting flow features to get more insights
* describe for every picture what you see and you want to be seen by the reader 
* what is your conclusion of the picture
* break the results down to single numbers, e.g.: 
    * (average) velocities (at specific points of interest)
    * pressure values
* this should be the biggest part in this report

actual study conclusions
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<!-- 
* what have you learned so far in this study 
* the overall conclusions should be placed in "Results" in the Management Summary
